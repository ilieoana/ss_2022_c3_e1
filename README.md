## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

This project was implemented as part of my learning journey with Spring Security. I followed the tutorial closely and:

- Recreated the project from scratch in my local environment.
- Created the all parts needed for a custom authentication with a secret key
- Started with the CustomAuthenticationFilter from SecurityFilterChain
- Implemented a CustomAuthenticationManager and next a CustomAuthenticationProvider
- Saved the Authentication object that is authenticated in the SecurityContext and then passED to the next filter from the chain
- The custom filter was created in place of UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter
